GitHub Pages are absolutely great. But, recently I have realized that there is another, a **complementary solution** which can bring your GitHub Pages to the next level: [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

Netlify offers easy-to-deploy, astonishing-fast web-hosting for static pages. And this all can be achieved with very little effort to move to Netlify, really a great solution!

I have moved a few GitHub Pages to Netlify within a few hours and the results are really amazing:

## My Approach

Let's assume you have a project on GithHub with some attached documentation (Hugo, Metalsmith, Jekyll, etc.):


## Conclusion

A few insights after moving to this solution:

- Caching of Github Pages is not an issue anymore:
  It happened so often to me that I was pushing something to GitHub Pages, but it took a while until I could see the changes, to caching on Github Pages is pretty aggressive.
- SSL for free
  I finally get SSL for free for all my pages, really neat.
