It's not that long ago that Microsoft was the bad guy for everything happening in the IT-industry. It was just cool to bash MS in favor of any Linux/Open-Source solution.

Now we have 2017, the situation has changed dramatically. So, what happened?

- Microsoft is starting to become cool, being the [Nr. 1 contributor in the Open Source world](http://www.businessinsider.de/microsoft-github-open-source-2016-9)
- Microsoft and Google have swapped places: "[Microsoft is The New Google, Google is the Old Microsoft](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/02/18/microsoft-google-swap/#767ef7223eb2)"
- GitHub has become one of the major dependencies for every IT-company

I claim that GitHub has a huge potential to become the **new bad guy in the industry**:

- Recently it was announced that [GitHub has merged 100 million pull requests](https://github.com/blog/2345-celebrating-nine-years-of-github-with-an-anniversary-sale).
- Microsoft, Google, Amazon have moved their most important Open Source repos to GitHub.
- Microsoft has [announced to shut down CodePlex](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2017/03/31/shutting-down-codeplex/) in favor of GitHub. 

Can you remember?

- Not that many years ago, [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) was the Nr. 1 Open Source platform.

Sure, there are other (minor) players

- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.org)

I cannot find any numbers, but I guess they are just negligible in terms of number of valuable and important repositories.

So what happens if GitHub is down for a few days, maybe even a week or two?

- Software companies cannot deliver anymore?
- CI/CD processes are broken, no deliveries to cloud services anymore ...
- Wake up, [GitHub can be down](https://twitter.com/Ozzmos/status/869895400404201473/photo/1)
 
 **Who is the next big player actually breaking the dependency from GitHub?**

 Just to make it crystal-clear:
 
 - I love GitHub and spend a significant amount of time on GitHub!
 - But I am actually scared about the dependency we all create on a working GitHub environment & service.
