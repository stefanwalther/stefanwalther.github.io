I like to blog. I like to share.   
In the recent years I have primarily created content on [qlikblog.at](http://www.qlikblog.at), then I shared quite some solutions & prototypes [on GitHub](https://github.com/stefanwalther) and recently I have started a new blog called [qliksite.io](http://qliksite.io)

**So why creating another blog?**

While all the other existing work primarily focuses on projects, prototypes to spread the word in the Qlik ecosystem (QlikView, Qlik Sense & Qlik Analytics Plaform), there is just more I want to write about:

- General programming topics
- I am a big fan and adopter of IoT
- I have three boys, two of them are entering an age where I can start building fun stuff (Raspberry PI, robots, etc.).

So this blog is just a private one, just a place to share some ideas & thoughts - without really taking care what the professional periphery thinks about it.
